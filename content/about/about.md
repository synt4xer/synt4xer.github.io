## Hello! I'm Ferrel üëãüèª

Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm a lifelong learner and passionate software engineer with a keen eye for web development and a dedication to building innovative, impactful solutions. My tech journey began in 2017 as a self-taught web developer, and since then, I've been on an exciting path of growth and exploration in software engineering.

Today, as a backend engineer specializing in Node.js and Go, I find joy in tackling problems, optimizing systems, and creating seamless user experiences. I‚Äôm constantly driven by a desire to expand my skills, embrace new technologies, and take on challenges that push my limits.

Whether it‚Äôs diving deep into architectural patterns or finding elegant solutions to improve performance, I approach every project with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering excellence.

### What I Do

I'm a backend engineer with a focus on Node.js and Go. For Node.js, I'd love to work with [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) and *TypeScript*, but I'm also open to other frameworks since I believe that the right tool for the job is more important than the framework itself. For Go, I'm working with [go-chi/chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi), [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx), and [uber/fx](https://github.com/uber-go/fx). But I'm always open to learning new things and exploring new technologies.

### My approach

1. **Crafting Code with Care**

   I believe that great code isn‚Äôt just about making things work‚Äîit‚Äôs about building solutions that are clean, scalable, and maintainable. Every line should add value, and every feature should serve a purpose. This mindset pushes me to not only solve problems but to solve them with a focus on quality and longevity.

2. **Embracing Lifelong Learning**

   Tech is always evolving, and I am passionate about evolving with it. Learning fuels my curiosity and keeps my skills sharp, whether it‚Äôs diving into a new framework, language, or tool. For me, each new challenge is an opportunity to grow and discover new ways to make an impact.

3. **User-Centric Development**

   Behind every piece of software is a person using it. I strive to build solutions that enhance user experiences, not just from a functional standpoint but also by focusing on usability, speed, and seamlessness. My goal is to ensure that my work has a positive, lasting effect on those who use it.

4. **Building with Integrity**

   Coding is a craft, and I am committed to upholding high standards of integrity and professionalism in every project. This means writing testable, dependable code, collaborating effectively, and always being mindful of best practices.

### Let's Connect

I'm open to collaboration, new opportunities, and discussions on all things tech. Whether you're interested in a potential project, want to discuss a tech idea, or just want to say hi, I'd love to hear from you!

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you!
